# Regression

Regression is a method for understanding the relationship between independent variables/features and a dependent variable/outcome. Linear regression involves finding a line that minimizes the difference between predicted and actual output values,
typically achieved through the least squares method. Simple linear regression calculators utilize this approach to determine the best-fit line for a given set of paid data, allowing estimation of the dependent variable (X) based on the independent variable (Y).

# Problem Statement 

We have a dataset comprising salaries of individuals alongside their respective years of professional experience. Our objective is to devlop a linear regression modle to accurately predict salaries based on an individual's experience. additionally, we aim to assess the model's accuracy once established.

# Variables 

Dependent Variable - Salary Independent Variable - YearsExperience

#Dataset

df=pd.read_csv('Salary_Data.csv')df
